Here you will find everything you need to know to get started with log.py, 
utilize it for your projects and master its features.

!!! note
    This documentation will **always** be for the latest version of log.py.
    Due to time constraints, there won't be dedicated documentation for every version of log.py.
    However, you can pull the documentation files from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SebastiaanBij/log.py) for each version,
    but this is not recommended as the latest stable build will always be your best option.
